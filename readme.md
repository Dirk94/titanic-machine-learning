# Titanic Machine Learning

This is my submission for https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

Usage: `./main.py`

Learns from the `train.csv` file.
Performs predictions on the `test.csv` file and writes the result to `output.csv`

My motivation for doing this Kaggle competition was to learn the basics of Machine Learning in Python
